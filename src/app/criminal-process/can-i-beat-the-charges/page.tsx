    <p className={styles.contentBreak}>Facing criminal charges is a daunting and stressful experience. Understanding your rights, the nature of the charges, and your available options is essential. Consulting a criminal lawyer is a critical step in building a strong defence to protect your future and beat the charges.</p>

    <h2>Have Your Rights Been Violated?</h2>
    <p className={styles.contentBreak}>Your constitutional rights must be upheld throughout the legal process. Violations such as unlawful searches, improper interrogations, or denial of access to legal counsel can greatly affect the outcome of your case. Identifying these violations is vital to your defence. A criminal lawyer will assess if your rights were breached and how to leverage this in court.</p>

    <h2>Can the Prosecution Prove Their Case?</h2>
    <p className={styles.contentBreak}>The prosecution bears the burden of proving your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. They must provide sufficient evidence to meet all elements of the offence. Assessing the strength of the prosecution&apos;s case is key to your defence. A criminal lawyer will review the evidence to uncover weaknesses that can be challenged in court.</p>

    <h2>How Evidence Shapes Your Defence</h2>
    <p className={styles.contentBreak}>Evidence is a cornerstone of any criminal case. Successfully challenging the evidence against you is crucial for creating a solid defence. A criminal lawyer will meticulously examine all evidence, highlight inconsistencies or errors, and craft strategies to weaken the prosecution&apos;s case.</p>
